AmazeJobs
=========
AmazeJobs keeps track of users’ job applications: their progress, deadlines, and tasks associated with each application. It strives to alleviate the users’ burden of remembering all the jobs they applied to, which of them responded, and tasks with deadlines that must not be forgotten.

Created with Node.js, Mongoose, Google Oauth, Handlebars, and EJS.
